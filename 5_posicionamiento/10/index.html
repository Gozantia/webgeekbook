    <p> The following demo shows how the remaining space is being calculated according to the different values of flex-grow (see on CodePen for better understanding</p>
    <p>it's defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. It accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion. It dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex container the item should take up.</p>
    <p>For example, if all items have flex-grow set to 1, every child will set to an equal size inside the container. If you were to give one of the children a value of 2, that child would take up twice as much space as the others.</p>    </p>
